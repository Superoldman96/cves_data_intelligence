        "description": "CLAUDE CODE IS AN AGENTIC CODING TOOL. VERSIONS BEFORE 1.0.111 WERE VULNERABLE TO CODE INJECTION DUE TO A BUG IN THE STARTUP TRUST DIALOG IMPLEMENTATION. CLAUDE CODE COULD BE TRICKED TO EXECUTE CODE CONTAINED IN A PROJECT BEFORE THE USER ACCEPTED THE STARTUP TRUST DIALOG. EXPLOITING THIS REQUIRES A USER TO START CLAUDE CODE IN AN UNTRUSTED DIRECTORY. USERS ON STANDARD CLAUDE CODE AUTO-UPDATE WILL HAVE RECEIVED THIS FIX AUTOMATICALLY. USERS PERFORMING MANUAL UPDATES ARE ADVISED TO UPDATE TO THE LATEST VERSION. THIS ISSUE IS FIXED IN VERSION 1.0.111.",
