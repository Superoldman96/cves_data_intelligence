INSTEAD, THE CURRENT CODE DOES THE OPPOSITE: IT SKIPS INACTIVE\nELEMENTS AND PROCESSES ACTIVE ONES.\n\nCOMPARE THE NON-CATCHALL ACTIVATE CALLBACK, WHICH IS CORRECT:\n\n  NFT_MAPELEM_ACTIVATE():\n    IF (NFT_SET_ELEM_ACTIVE(EXT, ITER->GENMASK))\n        RETURN 0;   /* SKIP ACTIVE, PROCESS INACTIVE */\n\nWITH THE BUGGY CATCHALL VERSION:\n\n  NFT_MAP_CATCHALL_ACTIVATE():\n    IF (!NFT_SET_ELEM_ACTIVE(EXT, GENMASK))\n        CONTINUE;   /* SKIP INACTIVE, PROCESS ACTIVE */\n\nTHE CONSEQUENCE IS THAT WHEN A DELSET OPERATION IS ABORTED,\nNFT_SETELEM_DATA_ACTIVATE() IS NEVER CALLED FOR THE CATCHALL ELEMENT.\nFOR NFT_GOTO VERDICT ELEMENTS, THIS MEANS NFT_DATA_HOLD() IS NEVER\nCALLED TO RESTORE THE CHAIN->USE REFERENCE COUNT. EACH ABORT CYCLE\nPERMANENTLY DECREMENTS CHAIN->USE. ONCE CHAIN->USE REACHES ZERO,\nDELCHAIN SUCCEEDS AND FREES THE CHAIN WHILE CATCHALL VERDICT ELEMENTS\nSTILL REFERENCE IT, RESULTING IN A USE-AFTER-FREE.\n\nTHIS IS EXPLOITABLE FOR LOCAL PRIVILEGE ESCALATION FROM AN UNPRIVILEGED\nUSER VIA USER NAMESPACES + NFTABLES ON DISTRIBUTIONS THAT ENABLE\nCONFIG_USER_NS AND CONFIG_NF_TABLES.\n\nFIX BY REMOVING THE NEGATION SO THE CHECK MATCHES NFT_MAPELEM_ACTIVATE():\nSKIP ACTIVE ELEMENTS, PROCESS INACTIVE ONES.",
