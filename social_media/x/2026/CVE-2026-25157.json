        "description": "OPENCLAW IS A PERSONAL AI ASSISTANT. PRIOR TO VERSION 2026.1.29, THERE IS AN OS COMMAND INJECTION VULNERABILITY VIA THE PROJECT ROOT PATH IN SSHNODECOMMAND. THE SSHNODECOMMAND FUNCTION CONSTRUCTED A SHELL SCRIPT WITHOUT PROPERLY ESCAPING THE USER-SUPPLIED PROJECT PATH IN AN ERROR MESSAGE. WHEN THE CD COMMAND FAILED, THE UNESCAPED PATH WAS INTERPOLATED DIRECTLY INTO AN ECHO STATEMENT, ALLOWING ARBITRARY COMMAND EXECUTION ON THE REMOTE SSH HOST. THE PARSESSHTARGET FUNCTION DID NOT VALIDATE THAT SSH TARGET STRINGS COULD NOT BEGIN WITH A DASH. AN ATTACKER-SUPPLIED TARGET LIKE -OPROXYCOMMAND=... WOULD BE INTERPRETED AS AN SSH CONFIGURATION FLAG RATHER THAN A HOSTNAME, ALLOWING ARBITRARY COMMAND EXECUTION ON THE LOCAL MACHINE. THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN PATCHED IN VERSION 2026.1.29.",
