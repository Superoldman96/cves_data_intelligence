THIS VULNERABILITY ALLOWS NETWORK-ADJACENT ATTACKERS TO EXECUTE ARBITRARY CODE ON AFFECTED INSTALLATIONS OF TP-LINK OMADA ER605 ROUTERS. AUTHENTICATION IS NOT REQUIRED TO EXPLOIT THIS VULNERABILITY. HOWEVER, DEVICES ARE VULNERABLE ONLY IF CONFIGURED TO USE THE COMEXE DDNS SERVICE.\n\nTHE SPECIFIC FLAW EXISTS WITHIN THE HANDLING OF DDNS ERROR CODES. THE ISSUE RESULTS FROM THE LACK OF PROPER VALIDATION OF THE LENGTH OF USER-SUPPLIED DATA PRIOR TO COPYING IT TO A FIXED-LENGTH STACK-BASED BUFFER. AN ATTACKER CAN LEVERAGE THIS VULNERABILITY TO EXECUTE CODE IN THE CONTEXT OF ROOT. WAS ZDI-CAN-22522.",
